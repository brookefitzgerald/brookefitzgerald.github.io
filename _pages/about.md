I’m a fourth year Ph.D. student in Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University, where my research combines data science and environmental economics to study the impacts of pollution and environmental change.

Raised on a dairy farm in rural Idaho, I developed an early appreciation for how environmental challenges shape economic realities.

Before graduate school, I worked as a data scientist, gaining experience with big data and machine learning—tools I now apply to pressing environmental questions. My current work includes using satellite and mobility data to measure the economic costs of wildfire smoke and using machine learning to fill global data gaps in smoke pollution exposure.

I’m also committed to making economics more inclusive, serving as a graduate liaison for the Women in Economics group and representing students in my department. Through research and outreach, I aim to inform equitable, data-driven environmental policy.
