    <p>I’m beginning my fourth year as a Ph.D. student in Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. I received my bachelors degree in Data Science and Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.hampshire.edu/">Hampshire College</a>. I worked as a data scientist for three years before beginning my Ph.D. in the <a href="https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/">Agricultural and Resource Economics Department</a> at Colorado State University.</p>

    <p>My research combines data science and environmental economics to study the interactions between pollution, environmental change, and humanity. I use machine learning, satellite imagery, and big data to answer important and policy relevant questions. My current work includes using satellite and mobility data to measure the economic costs of wildfire smoke and using machine learning to fill global data gaps in smoke pollution exposure. To read more about my research, please visit my <a href="https://brookefitzgerald.com/research/">research page</a>.</p>

    <p>I’m also committed to making economics more inclusive, serving as a graduate liaison for the Women in Economics group and representing students in my department. Through research and outreach, I aim to inform equitable, data-driven environmental policy.</p>
